      name: An Unearthly Child
      synopsis: Two schoolteachers, Barbara and Ian, follow one of their students
        (Susan) home, only to discover a strange policebox in a junkyard...
      review: The last 3 episodes of this story are dry and difficult to watch. They
        have several repeated scenes, and the plot is not very interesting

      synopsis: The travellers arive in China and meet Marco Polo. He coerces them
        into joining his caravan, and they end up embroiled in political intrigue
        in the far east...
      review: One of the first historical stories, and it works really well as a contrast
        to the stories around it. The villains are more complex and the problems they
        face are more personal. Not much action - which means the lack of video isn't
        a problem.

      review: This is a big story, divided into several little ones - a format that
        works very very well, and mitigates a lot of the pacing issues the early seasons
        had. However the script was rushed, and you can tell.

      synopsis: Barbara is mistaken as an Aztec God, and attempts to use this mistake
        to end the human sacrifices of the Aztecs, despite the Doctor's warnings about
        changing history...
      review: The Aztecs is a "historical" story, but it's such an innacurate view
        of the situation that it can hardly be called that at all. However, it is
        a very interesting plot.

      review: Surprisingly accurate and interesting. The 2 episodes which are missing
        footage are a slog to get through - without the motion, the pacing is more
        obviously slow

      review: This story is very important and very good, but at the same time the
        pacing is still incredibly slow. Definitely more worth a watch than many of
        the other early stories, which is why it gets a Watch recommendation
      number: 10
      majorPlotChanges: Susan leaves the TARDIS to marry a man she met, and help humanity to rebuild. The Doctor says a very heartfelt fairwell, and that scene alone is definitely worth watching.

      review: A silly concept, with poor execution - the trojans are portrayed as
        unbelievably dense, and then Vicki falls for one and runs off with him. I
        had trouble suspending my disbelief for this one.
      number: 20
      majorPlotChanges: Vicki stays with a warrior from Troy, to help him rebuild. (As I mentioned above, I did not find this a particularly realistic or interesting way for the character to be written out). As she leaves, she sends Katarina, a handmaiden, into the TARDIS to help the Doctor.

      review: One of the darkest and most violent stories in the early show, and it
        is incredibly engaging... with the exception of the 7th episode, which was
        scheduled to be broadcast on Christmas Day. It doesn't tie in to the actual
        plot, and is basically just a farcical interlude

      majorPlotChanges: Katarina is killed while saving the Doctor from an assailant (the first death of a companion in the series). Sara Kingdom, a former guard of Mavic Chen, joins the Doctor for a while, but she too meets her end. The story concludes with the Doctor and Steven lamenting their deaths.
